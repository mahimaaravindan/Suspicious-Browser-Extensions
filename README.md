# Suspicious-Browser-Extensions

🔹 Step-by-Step Guide

1. Open your browser’s extension/add-ons manager.
Chrome / Edge: Click the three dots → Extensions → Manage Extensions.
Firefox: Menu (☰) → Add-ons and Themes → Extensions.
Safari: Safari → Preferences → Extensions.

2. Review all installed extensions carefully.
Look at the list of extensions installed.
Note down names and purposes.

3. Check permissions and reviews for each extension.
Click Details or More Info on each extension.
Look at permissions (e.g., “Can read all data on websites you visit”). If permissions seem excessive for the extension’s purpose, that’s a red flag.
If available, open the extension’s store page → check developer details, ratings, and user reviews.

4. Identify unused or suspicious extensions.
Unused: Extensions you installed but don’t use anymore.
Suspicious: Unknown developer, very high permissions (like “read and change all your data on websites”), poor reviews, or not from official web stores.

5. Remove suspicious or unnecessary extensions.
Click Remove or Uninstall next to the extension name.
If unsure, disable it instead of removing, then test browser behavior.

6. Restart browser and check for performance improvements.
Close and reopen the browser.
Notice if it runs faster, uses less memory, or stops showing pop-ups/ads.

7. Research how malicious extensions can harm users.
Some common risks:
Stealing login credentials.
Injecting ads and pop-ups.
Tracking browsing history.
Redirecting you to phishing sites.
Using your device for cryptomining.

8. Document steps taken and extensions removed.
For documentation (if this is an assignment or project), you can write:
Which browser you used.
List of extensions before cleanup.
Which ones you removed (and why).
Observations after restarting (e.g., performance, security).
